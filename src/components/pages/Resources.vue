            This is a seven-week study. We were all made to worship. The question is, “What are we worshipping?” If we are not worshipping God, we are worshipping something else. The Bible calls this idolatry. This study is designed to look at some of the idols that students on college campuses face. Topics include: worshipping the god of achievement; worshipping the god of sex; worshipping the god of substances; worshipping the god of information; and more.</p>
